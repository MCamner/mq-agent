## v1.15.0 — Brain-integrated stack workflow

Goal: make mq-agent the stable conductor of the full loop —
repo status → review → learn extract → brain write → stack truth export
→ next action. mq-agent orchestrates; mq-mcp thinks/runs, repo-signal
measures, mqobsidian remembers, mqlaunch launches.

* [x] `mq-agent stack cockpit` — one table for the whole stack:
  repo, status, branch, dirty, version, contract, release gate,
  brain export freshness, next action. Later the input to mq-hal.
* [x] Consistent flag behaviour across write-capable commands:
  `--dry-run` never writes, `--json` machine-readable, `--brain`
  never writes without an explicit command, `--approve` required
  for write flows.
* [ ] Standard mqobsidian export structure: `memory/stack-truth/`,
  `memory/reviews/`, `memory/learn/`, `mq-stack/runs/`, `mq-stack/roadmaps/`
* [ ] Brain release gate: `contract-check` + `release-check` +
  `truth-export --dry-run` + `review repo --brain --dry-run` green before release
* [ ] Docs sync: README, docs/ROADMAP, MQ_ECOSYSTEM, CHANGELOG, repo-contract
* [ ] Tag v1.15.0

## v1.14.0 — Stack release orchestration

Goal: close the loop. The stack suite observes (`status`, `report`, `sweep`,
`history`), gates (`alert`, `release-check`, `contract-check`), remembers
(`truth-export`), and drafts (`release-notes`) — but the release itself is
still manual, per repo, across 7 repos. `stack release` makes the pipeline act.

* [x] `mq-agent stack release --repo <name>` — orchestrated single-repo release:
  release-check as pre-gate, version bump, changelog update from the
  release-notes draft, tag, push
* [x] Dry-run by default (same pattern as `sweep`); `--execute` to apply
* [x] `--json` — machine-readable output for CI
* [x] Automatic `truth-export` after a successful release, so the release
  lands in mqobsidian memory
* [x] Abort cleanly on any failed step — no half-released repos
* [x] `docs/STACK_RELEASE.md` — reference doc
* [x] Tests for gate refusal, dry-run plan, step failure rollback (27 tests)
* [x] Tag v1.14.0

## v1.13.0 — mqobsidian stack truth export

Goal: turn stack gate results into durable mqobsidian memory, not transient CI logs.

* [x] `mq-agent stack truth-export` — truth note from contract-check + release-check
* [x] `mq-agent stack export` kept as backwards-compatible alias
* [x] Dated default note path under `~/mqobsidian/memory/stack-truth/`
* [x] `--ci` mode for stack gates; two-job CI workflow (fast PR gate + full stack gate)
* [x] 25 new tests (439 total)
* [x] Tag v1.13.0
